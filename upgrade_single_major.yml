# upgrade_single_major.yml - PAN-OS single firewall major version upgrade playbook.
#
# Description
# ===========
#
# Performs a major version upgrade (i.e. 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5) on a single PAN-OS device.  This playbook simply imports the
# other playbooks in this repository making up the parts of this process (content upgrade, download base image, install
# target version).
#
# This playbook requires connection details for the deivce to be specified in the variables 'ip_address', 'username',
# and 'password'.  These may be defined as host variables (see `host_vars/firewall.yml` for an example) or
# extra vars.
#
# Usage
# =====
#
# Required variables:
#
#   target: Target PAN-OS device, as named in the inventory.  See `host_vars/firewall.yml` for sample
#           definition of host variables.
#
#   base_version: Base version downloaded to the device.  This version is not installed (for example, the 9.0.0 base
#                 image in the 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5 upgrade process).
#
#   target_version: Version of PAN-OS to ultimately install on the device (for example, 9.0.5 in the 8.1.12 -> 9.0.5
#                   upgrade process).
#
# See the VARS section of the playbook for additional customization options.
#
# Default run:
#
#  $ ansible-playbook -i inventory upgrade_single_major.yml --extra-vars "target=firewall base_version=9.0.0 target_version=9.0.5"
